# OdysseyGameEngine

My own GLFW & OpenGL based game engine.

To compile example game (nothing special yet) use ```make``` and run with ```./example.out```.
Remember to create ```bin``` directory, otherwise compilation will fail.

While in game you can move around the area with WAD keys just like in any platfor game.
