# OdysseyGameEngine

My own GLFW & OpenGL based game engine.

To compile an example game use ```make``` and run with ```./example.out```.
Remember to create a ```bin``` directory, otherwise the compilation will fail.

While in game you can move around the area with WAD keys just like in any platform game.
